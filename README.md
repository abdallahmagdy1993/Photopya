# Photopya
It’s a tool to make it easy to put a logo, watermark or a text on an image instead of using huge software to make this light command. It doesn’t consume memory, fast and user-friendly interface.

It’s a windows (XP, vista, 7, 8 and 8.1) desktop Application, that can add a logo, watermark and text to a photo with extension (bmp, jpg, jpeg, png and gif), and editing them by moving, resizing and its transparency.
